welcome to pgtttl! (aka python games took to the limit)

the games will say stuff like "i have control of your pc" or so.

remember they is not realy a virus and is only a game.

plus, to stop the game you just close command promt.

and it will act like a virus.

again, THIS IS ONLY A GAME.

the normal game can add files to your desktop or bluescreen your pc.

the safe one will not.

if you want, use the safe one

also read directions

also this is a scrap game and i was just experimenting with python.
