welcome to pgtttl! (aka python games took to the limit)

the games will say stuff like "i have control of your pc" or so.

remember they is not realy a virus and is only a game.

plus, to stop the game you just close command promt.

and it will act like a virus.

again, THIS IS ONLY A GAME.

and yes i will upload a "safe" version.

the current one can add files to your desktop or bluescreen your pc.

the safe one will not.
